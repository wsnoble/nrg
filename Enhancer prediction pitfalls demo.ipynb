    "# Enhancer Prediction Pitfalls Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates several potential pitfalls of machine learning in genomics, utilizing Python and the scikit-learn machine learning package.  Broad discussion of these pitfalls can be found in our Nature Reviews Genetics paper (link).  Some are well known and not specific to genomics, while others have particular relevance in the field and may be under-appreciated.  The latter are primarily characterized by violations of the Independent and Identically-Distributed (IID) assumption made by most statistical models; see [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) for a detailed introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to build a binary classifier for enhancers in the K562 cell line.  There are many potential sources of enhancer labels and features for such a problem; our formulation is as follows.  Rows of the feature matrix are [FANTOM5 Capped Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE)](https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/datafiles/reprocessed/hg38_latest/extra/enhancer/) genomic regions.  Columns are binary features encoding if the region overlaps a statistically significant ChIP-seq peak for a histone modification or transcription factor (TF) assayed by ENCODE in K562.  A region is labeled 1 if its CAGE expression was non-zero in K562, and 0 if there was no expression in K562.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could use this classifier to make predictions in a related cell line where CAGE has not been performed, or to examine what features are most predictive of K562 CAGE-defined enhancers.  Using known biology, we would expect activating histone marks and TFs to have large positive coefficients in the model, and repressive histone marks and TFs to have large negative coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will first load features and labels, define several scikit-learn objects needed to demonstrate various pitfalls, and finally use those objects to fit models and evaluate performance.  Multiple performance metrics will be stored after each evaluation and summarized at the end for simple comparison.\n",

    "This summary showcases many pitfalls of machine learning, both in general and with respect to applications in genomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that accuracy is typically very high when area under the precision-recall (auPR) or the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) curves are low.  This is characteristic of problems with major class imbalance, as accuracy simply measures the percent of predictions that are correct without respect to their proportion in the dataset.  Thus, a \"model\" that always predicts 0 when 96% of the labels are 0 will have an accuracy of 96%.  However, it will never correctly predict the minority class, and this is often the class of interest in genomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that auROC can be high when auPR is low.  The ROC curve is formed by values of the true positive rate (tpr) and false positive rate (fpr) at different classifier thresholds:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tpr = \\frac{tp}{tp + fn}$$\n",
    "$$fpr = \\frac{fp}{fp + tn}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where tp = # true positives, fp = # false positives, tn = # true negatives, and fn = # false negatives.  Precision and recall are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{precision} = \\frac{tp}{tp + fp}$$\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{recall} = tpr = \\frac{tp}{tp + fn}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For highly imbalanced problems in genomics, the majority negative class is often much easier to predict than the minority positive class.  In such cases, the number of true negatives will be high and drive the false positive rate very low, impacting auROC.  True negatives are not measured by precision or recall, so auPR is not inflated by easy-to-predict majority classes.  This makes auPR a better choice than auROC for some (but not all) problems in genomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, feature selection performed outside CV leads to higher performance compared to selection performed inside CV.  The improvement here is not drastic, but often is; this estimator selects a percentage of features based on their individual correlations with the class label, rather than considering features jointly.  Selecting features using a multivariate linear model with an L1 penalty outside CV leads to an even larger gap.  Another procedure performed outside CV balances the number of positive and negative classes by downsampling the majority class.  This drastically inflates performance, especially when combined with feature selection; the resulting auPR of 0.81 is nearly twice that of the same model evaluated correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, note that shuffled k-fold CV reports higher auPR than cross-chromosome validation.  Regions on the same chromosome may not be independent and thus have highly correlated features (violating independence in the IID assumption), making it easier for a model that trains one sample to accurately predict the label of another correlated sample.  Shuffling samples and creating training/test splits that ignore these potential correlations can inflate performance.  Using cross-cromosome validation, where all samples on the same chromosome are placed in either the training or test set, prevents this type of inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Samples might also violate the identically-distributed portion of the IID assumption, having features that are distributed differently across chromosomes due to the underlying biology.  In this example, samples are not highly correlated; we will show the performance difference is due such such differences in feature distribution.  We can test this by building an adversarial classifier that tries to predict which chromosome a sample originates from, rather than trying to predict the enhancer label."

    "The p-value for the difference-of-proportions test is significant for the top 5 features.  Repeating this test for the least predictive features shows no significant p-values.  In summary, features the model finds most predictive are also distributed somewhat differently across chromosomes, causing a moderate drop in performance when the model is forced to train on samples from only one chromosome and predict on another."
